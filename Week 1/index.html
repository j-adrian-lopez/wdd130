    <h2>Adrian Lopez</h2>

    <p> Hi, everyone! My name is Adrian Lopez, and I'm from Asuncion, Paraguay.<br>
        I'm majoring in Applied Business Management, and this is my last (I hope!) semester.
        However, I'm taking this class because I also like programming and web dev a lot. </p>

    <p> I like listening to music and cooking. I also like reading and learning new things.
        I am married since 2017 to my wife, Laura. The picture I posted is a picture of our wedding.
        We still got no children.<br>
        I used to be a professional bassoonist, but the pandemic helped me switch fields.
        The BYU-I Online experience has helped me grow in the business field, and now I am an Operations Manager for a trading and international freight company.<br>
        I would also like to get a degree in Tech to link both fields in my professional development. To
        achieve this, after I graduate in Business I want to re-apply to BYU-I to get a degree in Web Dev.<br>
        I wish you all good luck!</p>
