      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Tallulah Nail Salon is a new startup that pretends to enter the market with innovative ideas for nail health and beauty. The overall idea of the website is, first, to offer an interactive landing site that will encourage people to interact with the company and get conversions through appointment bookings. The Home Page should show, right off the bat, images and text that will tell and show visitors the quality of the service. It will also have a “prices and promotions” button (besides the one in the navigation bar) because people are usually immediately interested in the prices, they will pay for a service to know they are not aiming for something they cannot pay. Pictures that show some of the finished jobs will be used to pique the prospect’s curiosity about what they can get with the salon.
Another button that will be very necessary is a “Book Now” button, which will redirect people to a WhatsApp (extremely popular in Latin America) link that will allow them to send a message and book an appointment. A textbox explaining why Tallulah is their best option will be included, besides explaining in a short text what are the advantages of having beautifully crafted and painted nails. The available techniques may also be listed in the Home Page. The address of the salon is also mandatory, so people would be able to visit the place in case they prefer on meeting the artist personally before booking.

      </ul>
      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        On the About Us page it will be included the information about the certifications, experience, and education of Laura, the nail artist. It will display, in a concise manner, the mission/vision of the company, and the desires it has to offer top quality service to satisfy the demands of the clients. It will contain a professional picture of Laura and of her at work with a client, which would increase the trust a potential customer may have on her skills.
Contact number, email address, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok profiles will be included in the About Us page to animate visitors to befriend the salon on social media and see new finished jobs displayed each week. This invitation will increase the interaction between the clients and the firm, attaining the objectives of increasing brand awareness, starting to stir customer advocacy, and easing the marketing work by allowing anyone to share the site with friends and family.

      </ul>
      <h3>Prices and Promotions</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, but not less important, we must solve two of the client’s most frequent questions immediately: why advantage would I get if I choose your salon over other salons, and what price would I pay for such a beautiful work? The Prices and Promotions page will answer these questions. The price list will contain some more nail images and the regular prices for the different services (acrylic nails, polygel, gel nails, one and two step gel polish service, nail maintenance, and so on). This will already make the visitor comfortable, helping the person know the prices the technician charges without having to ask and wait for a response. The promotion section will contain a list of easily updatable promotional prices for the purchase of a service package that contains two or more services done consecutively in the same appointment. Finally, it will also be included a “request a special quotation” button (that will redirect to the aforementioned WhatsApp link) so the customer can ask for specific services (3d Nails, cat-eyes polish, and so on).
